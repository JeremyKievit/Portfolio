To upload and test my website on a server, I used Github pages (I typically use XAMP but I had some issues with the download). These are the steps I followed:

1. Created a local repository
2. Staged and committed my files
3. Created a remote repository on GitHub
4. Connected the local repository and pushed my commits
5. Set up GitHub Pages for the repository (Settings > Pages > Branch > main > save)
